Just renders.\nSupports Template-Driven Forms and Reactive Forms\ni18n ready architecture\nDefault error message\nCustomizable\nCascading configuration\n\nInstall\nnpm install ngx-form-errorsQuick start\nIn your application root module definition add NgxFormErrorsModule:\nimport { NgxFormErrorsModule } from 'ngx-form-errors';\n\n// lots of code...\n\n@NgModule({\n  bootstrap: [ /* ... */ ],\n  declarations: [ /* ... */ ],\n  imports: [\n    /* ... */\n    NgxFormErrorsModule.forRoot()\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule { /* lots of code... */ }You can also set default error messages:\nimport { NgxFormErrorsModule, NgxErrorsService } from 'ngx-form-errors';\n\n@NgModule({\n  /* bla bla yada yada */\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n  constructor(ngxErrorsService: NgxErrorsService) {\n    ngxErrors.setDefaultMessage('required', 'This field is required');\n  }\n}\nDefault error messages are only used when error returns true instead of a string.\nAn example is the built in required validator.\n\nCreate a global error template in the template of the application's root component:\nBootstrap example:\n{{item.message}}\n\nMaterial example:\n{{item.message}}\n\nThis template contains the instructions for how to render an error.\nYou can supply any template, the library does not care.\nNow, in your forms set error components and attach them to controls:\nTemplate Driven example:\n\n  \n      Name\n      \n          \n          \n      \n  \nReactive example:\n\n  \n      Name\n      \n          \n          \n      \n  \nReactive example with material design:\n\n  \n      Name\n      \n          \n          \n      \n  \n\nIn material, the presence of md-error is important, it must exists next to the control.\nThis is why  is used, however the actual rendered errors\nare based on the template!\n\nAdvanced features:\nConfiguration:\nError templates comes with a declarative API to customise the behaviour.\nThings like maximum errors to display, the order of display, render predicate and more...\nThese are all sugar helpers and can be done manually within your templates.\nRead more in the documentation...\nMultiple error template:\nSupplying one template is enough for most use cases.\nHowever, some scenarios requires custom templates.\nngx-form-errors support multiple templates using hierarchy.\nA template can be set per:\n\nNgModule\nComponent\nNgForm\nError component content\n\nWhen the library looks up for a template to use, the closest template to the element is selected (bottom first in the list).\nThe hierarchy is managed via DOM structure (Error component content & NgForm) and angular's DI for Component & NgModule.\nRead more in the documentation for NgxErrorTemplateDirective\nExamples:\nTake a look at the demo app where you can find examples by feature, Reactive Forms example and a Template Driven forms example\nWhy\nRendering @angular/forms errors is usually a simple task but one that\nrepeats itself over and over.\nWhen things spice up, any they always do, it gets more verbose:\nA control with multiple validators requires an error component for each\nvalidator so the error (if exists) coming from a validator will display.\nA Form with 3 fields, each with 3 validators required 9 components!\nAnd we're not done, rendering an error is usually done under some\nrestrictions (conditions), most likely based on the control state (dirty, touched, etc)\nthis adds more declarative template code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"overview.html":{"url":"overview.html","title":"overview -

The 1st\nwill be the global, then 2nd will be a specific error template for the required error.\n\nAdding a 3rd template without an errorKey will just override the first template.\n\nA context store is bound to it's immediate NgxErrorsService instance (Angular service).\nNgxErrorsService holds 2 types of stores, the global (default) store and a scoped store.\nA context store is just a collection of Template definitions, these Templates are attached to\ntheir immediate NgxErrorsService instance scoped store or global store.\nA scope is DOM block which acts as a context container and captures all template definitions\ndefined within it.\nThere are 2 types of context containers (DOM Blocks):\n\nTemplate definition defined as DOM content within NgxErrorsComponent\nTemplate definition defined within a ControlContainer\nA ControlContainer can be NgForm, NgModelGroup, FormGroup etc... depending on your forms\nimplementation (Template vs Reactive)\n\n\nThe global store is actually a container as well, its just the root container so it can also\nbe considered as a scope, a basket (catch all) scope.\n\nThe first hit (from top) defines the container that a template definition belongs to.\nA Template definition that hit one of the rules above belongs to the scoped collection within\nit's immediate NgxErrorsService, otherwise it belongs to the global store.\nThere can only be one template attached to each unique context.\n\nA Store has one unique global context and a unique context for each specific error key defined.\nNgxErrorsComponent has one unique global store and\n\nThis structure allows fine-grained configuration at the app level, specific form level and when\nneeded at the component level. For both specific errors and globally.\nAn application must have at least one default template attached to the root NgxErrorsService.\nSince angular services are also based on hierarchy which is DOM based creating additional\nproviders for NgxErrorsService (at module level or component level) will create a new\nhierarchy level with the previous NgxErrorsService instance as it's parent.\n\nWhen a global template is not defined within a store the template from the parent is taken.\nWhen a specific error key is not defined within a store the key search on the parent (up to the root) and\nif not found the global template is used.\n\n\n            \n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                        NgxDisplayContext\n
